;;This is the basis for bootstrapping clojure onto common lisp.
;;I figure if I can define the primitive forms that clojure requires, 
;;there's already a ton of clojure written in clojure.  The clojurescript
;;runtime actually has a significant portion of clojure defined via protocols,
;;which given limited forms, provides a pretty slick way to bootstrap an 
;;implementation.
;;A couple of big hurdles: 
;;1) Lisp1 vs Lisp2.  I'll hack the evaluator for this.
;;2) Persistent structures.  Already built Pvector and 1/2 done with Pmap.
;;3) Protocols.  Already implemented as generic functions. 
;;4) Multimethods.  Need to find a way to implement multiple dispatch.
;;5) Reader.  CL macros use , and ,@ in place of ~ and ~@ in Clojure.
;;            We'll need to either cook the common lisp reader, or 
;;            build a separate clojure reader that will perform the
;;            appropriate replacements.
;;            @ is a literal for #'deref in clojure
;;            , is whitespace in clojure.
;;            [] denote vectors -> already have a reader macro in pvector.lisp
;;            {} denote maps    -> already have a reader macro in pmap.lisp
;;           #{} denote sets
;;6) Destructuring.  This may be a bit tricky, although there are a limited number of 
;;                   clojure forms.  Since we have reader
;;7)Seq library.  This shouldn't be too hard.  I already have a lazy list lib prototype
;;                as well as generic functions for the basic ops.  I think I'll try to 
;;                use the protocols defined in the clojurescript version as much possible,
;;                rather than baking in a lot of the seq abstraction in the host language
;;                like clojure does.

;;In reality, we could have an assload of arities to deal with, since clojure 
;;allows it (up to some arbitrary number like 20?) 


;;Aside from that, for each specific function spec, we need to parse the args 
;;and introduce an appropriate function spec....

;;That's where destructuring comes in. 
;;destructuring takes a binding form of a vector 

;;The following two forms really boil down to 
;;(fn [map-arg] ...)
;;(fn [&map-arg] ...)

;;map destructuring...
;;(fn [&{:keys [x y] :or {x v1 y v2} :as my-map}] ~body) ->

;;The following forms boil down to 
;;(fn [vector-arg arg] body)
;;(fn [& vector-arg]  body)

;;(fn [[x y] z] body) ->
;; (lambda (coll z)
;;   (let* ((x (first coll))
;;           y (second coll)))
;;       ,@body)

;;(fn [& xs] ~body) -> (lambda (&args xs) body)

;;destructuring, in general, is the process of transforming a sequence of 
;;args into an appropriate binding.  
;;since args are unified to always be in vectors, it's tranforming a vector 
;;into something.

;;a binding form may include primitive symbols, with the symbol & delineating 
;;list arguments.  everything after & is to be bound to a list.
;;note -> further destructuring may occur here...
;;[x y & z] 
;;So, we recursively destructure the binding form.  
;;We can bifurcate the process more if we split the destructuring into special cases.
;;The first case is that we haven't hit & yet, so we are collecting simple structures. 
;;The second case is after we've hit &. 

;;If we are in case 1, we traverse the vector of symbols and see if they're compound. 
;;The only cases to handle are 
;;Symbol   -> Symbol 
;;Vector   -> (destructure vector)  ;;recursive call 
;;hash-map -> (destructure hash-map) ;;more complex destructuring.
