;;This is the basis for bootstrapping clojure onto common lisp.
;;I figure if I can define the primitive forms that clojure requires, 
;;there's already a ton of clojure written in clojure.  The clojurescript
;;runtime actually has a significant portion of clojure defined via protocols,
;;which given limited forms, provides a pretty slick way to bootstrap an 
;;implementation.
;;A couple of big hurdles: 
;;1) Lisp1 vs Lisp2.  I'll hack the evaluator for this.
;;2) Persistent structures.  Already built Pvector and 1/2 done with Pmap.
;;3) Protocols.  Already implemented as generic functions. 
;;4) Multimethds.  Need to find a way to implement multiple dispatch.
;;5) Reader.  CL macros use , and ,@ in place of ~ and ~@ in Clojure.
;;            We'll need to either cook the common lisp reader, or 
;;            build a separate clojure reader that will perform the
;;            appropriate replacements.
;;            @ is a literal for #'deref in clojure
;;            , is whitespace in clojure.
;;            [] denote vectors -> already have a reader macro in pvector.lisp
;;            {} denote maps    -> already have a reader macro in pmap.lisp
;;           #{} denote sets
;;6) Destructuring.  This may be a bit tricky, although there are a limited number of 
;;                   clojure forms.  Since we have reader
;;7)Seq library.  This shouldn't be too hard.  I already have a lazy list lib prototype
;;                as well as generic functions for the basic ops.  I think I'll try to 
;;                use the protocols defined in the clojurescript version as much possible,
;;                rather than baking in a lot of the seq abstraction in the host language
;;                like clojure does.                
;;more?

;;loading handled by asdf now.
;;(load "common-utils.lisp") ;useful stuff like comment, keyword creation, and more.
;;(load "protocols.lisp")
;;(load "pvector.lisp") ;imports reader macros for vector literals i.e. [1 2 3] 
;(load "pmap.lisp")  ;once pmap is finished, it'll be really useful for  
;(load "seq.lisp") ;might be nice to go ahead and clone the seq library to make this simpler.

;;Some basic stuff to facilitate clojure forms.

;;I think we want to use persistent maps for meta data, as clojure does.
;;I want to get the stubs in place, and am using property lists with a 'meta 
;;entry pointing at an assoc list for now.
(defmacro meta (symb) `(get (quote ,symb) 'meta))
(defmacro with-meta (symb m) `(setf (get (quote ,symb) 'meta) ,m))

;;Clojure is a lisp-1, so we need to ensure that everything, even 
;;functions, gets bound into the a single namespace. 

;;another way to do this is to have clojure-specific symbols be actual 
;;clos objects, which have meta data fields automatically.  Then we 
;;lose out on all the built in goodies from common lisp though.

;;Experimental.  Not sure of how to approach this guy.

;;We have a lisp1, sorta! 
;;I need to add in some more evaluation semantics, but this might be the 
;;way to go.  For now, it allows us to have clojure semantics for functions 
;;and macros.  There's still some delegation to the common lisp evaluator - which is 
;;not a bad thing at all!
